# devops-assignment
Submission as part of the hiring process at Vernacular-Ai for DevOps Engineer role.

### 1. Docker
Docker is a tool to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. It allows a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies thus allowing him/her to `Build once Run Anywhere`.

You have to write a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) with **Ubuntu 16.04** as a base image. The image should have following packages present:
- telnet
- curl
- ffmpeg

Finally, when running a container from the docker image, it should launch with `bash`.

Deliverables:
- A Dockerfile
- A README file with instructions on how to build and run the image


### 2. Auditing Hardware
We work with companies that require our solution to be deployed on premise. For that we receive hardware, and auditing that hardware becomes important part of our deployment process.

Write a bash script to audit the following hardware spec in [RHEL](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux). The script should print out following specifications:
- OS version
- Kernel version
- CPU - Virtual cores (ratio to physical cores if possible)
- CPU - Clock speed
- CPU - Architecture
- RAM
- Networking - Bandwidth
- Networking - OS Firewall (Allowed Ports & Protocols)
- Networking - Network Firewall (Allowed Ports & Protocols)
- Disk - Mounted/Unmounted volumes, type, storage


### 3. Managing Disk Space
We provide call center automation as one of our products. Essentially it processes user's audio and return a correct audio response. For managing all these audios that are generated in the due process we use [NFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System). With the call volumes we have, it essential that disk space of NFS should be managed properly.

Write a bash script to clean out all the audios in `/home/ubuntu/audios/` folder that are older than *48hrs*. Also generate a log file with the name `deleted-files-<date>-<month>-<year>.log` which should contain:
- name of audio file
- time of creation of audio file ([ISO Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601))
- time of deletion of audio file ([ISO Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601))

For example: A sample log file `deleted-files-12-02-2020.log` will contain:
```shell
audio_0010023.wav 10-02-2020T08:37:16+05:30 12-02-2020T10:18:40+05:30
audio_0010024.wav 10-02-2020T08:38:16+05:30 12-02-2020T10:18:42+05:30
audio_0010025.wav 10-02-2020T08:38:50+05:30 12-02-2020T10:18:45+05:30
...
```
